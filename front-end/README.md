## Files Added To Project

[ ] Faq.js
A frequently asked questions form, so anyone with a Dev question can go and look before submitting a ticket.

[ ] Register.js
A form for anyone that wants access to the site. They have to register a new account to do so.

[ ] TicketList.js
The TicketList file will only be shown by Dev Admins, it will include but not limited to collecting, storing, listing data such as user name,title, reputation lvl and currentIssue. There will also be an archive, delete and pending, accepted button, these buttons will act as a status report for the end user. These buttons will be linked to the user that created the post to give them reassurance that their issue is being handled. These buttons will also have the Developers information, slightly the same as user. Name, title, reputation lvl, and status of ticket.

[ ] Ticket.js
Ticket file will have the input of the User complaints. The thought is instead of a user inputting their first and last name every time, we can route their user-card above the questions and options. If not the the Ticket file will ask for input such as first and last name, with a chose of options, and a window to input what they are experiencing. With also a Submit Button.

[ ] Header.js
Header file will have all the appropriate route(s), and admin/user information.

[ ] Login.js
Login file is just that, someplace the user can login to their account and post an issue. This file will collect user name and password, and will need to have the ability to refuse connection if data not inputted correctly or not at all. The login can also have a random password generator. And ask for a set # of characters & numbers for username and password.
